Input questions and options to prompt the AI model to generate corresponding answers.
### Part 1 - Success Rate Calculation:
Calculate the success rate of question generation and answer accuracy.
### Part 2 - Answer Review Mechanism:
Validate generated answers by comparing them against answers generated by an independent model.
### Part 3 - Google Search Integration:
Optionally include Google search results in answer generation for enhanced accuracy and relevance.

Before running the script, make sure to configure the following parameters:
- train_file: Path to the JSON file containing training questions.
- train_label_file: Path to the JSON file containing corresponding answers.
- is_google_search_available: Set to True if you want to include Google search results in answer generation.

## View Results
The script will display the success rates for question generation and answer accuracy. You can also observe any improvement in success rates when Google search functionality is enabled.

## Customization
Modify the main() function as needed to customize the behavior of the question generator.
